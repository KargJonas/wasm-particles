This is a demo project to measure WebAssembly vs JS performance. The particle system imitates electromagnetic attraction and repulsion between two types of differently charged particles. Additionally, there is friction and primitive collision detection.

In order to build this, you will need [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html).
